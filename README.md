1. All about Hello World

2. 0x01-variables_if_else_while
	A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive.


3. 0x02-functions_nested_loops
	This Directory holds functions/loops etc.

The Function prototype serves the following purposes – 

1) It tells the return type of the data that the function will return. 

2) It tells the number of arguments passed to the function. 

3) It tells the data types of each of the passed arguments. 

4) Also it tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.

	Therefore essentially, the function prototype specifies the input/output interlace to the function i.e. what to give to the function and what to expect from the function.

The prototype of a function is also called the signature of the function.

What if one doesn’t specify the function prototype? 

	The output of the below kinds of programs is generally asked at many places. 

4. 0x03. C - Debugging
<<<<<<< HEAD
	Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.


5. 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
Here we attempt more practice on Functions and Nested loops.

6. 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
Lets try out Pointers, arrays and spring
